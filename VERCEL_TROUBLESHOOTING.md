# Troubleshooting Vercel Deployment with PostgreSQL

This guide addresses common issues when deploying a Next.js application with Prisma and PostgreSQL to Vercel.

## Common Deployment Issues

### 1. Database Connection Issues

**Problem**: The most common issue with Vercel deployments is database connection errors, especially in serverless environments.

**Solution**:

1. **Update your DATABASE_URL** in Vercel environment variables with connection pooling parameters:
   ```
   postgresql://username:password@hostname:port/database?schema=public&connection_limit=5&pool_timeout=10
   ```

2. **Enable connection pooling** if using an external PostgreSQL provider:
   - For Supabase: Use the connection pooling string they provide
   - For Railway/Neon/etc.: Add the connection pooling parameters

3. **Verify database accessibility**:
   - Ensure your database allows connections from Vercel's IP ranges
   - Check if your database requires SSL (add `sslmode=require` to your connection string)

### 2. Prisma Client Generation Issues

**Problem**: Prisma client not being generated correctly during build.

**Solution**:

1. **Explicitly generate Prisma client** in your build command:
   ```json
   "buildCommand": "npx prisma generate && npm run build"
   ```

2. **Check for Prisma binary compatibility** issues:
   - Add `"postinstall": "prisma generate"` to your package.json scripts
   - Use the `PRISMA_GENERATE_DATAPROXY=true` environment variable

### 3. Environment Variable Issues

**Problem**: Missing or incorrect environment variables.

**Solution**:

1. **Verify all required environment variables** are set in Vercel:
   - Go to your project settings â†’ Environment Variables
   - Add DATABASE_URL and any other required variables
   - Make sure to add variables to Production, Preview, and Development environments

2. **Check for sensitive characters** in your environment variables:
   - Special characters in passwords might need URL encoding
   - Wrap the connection string in quotes if it contains special characters

### 4. Build Process Issues

**Problem**: Build process failing due to dependencies or configuration.

**Solution**:

1. **Check build logs** for specific errors:
   - Look for error messages in the Vercel deployment logs
   - Pay attention to any failed steps during the build process

2. **Update Next.js configuration**:
   - Ensure your next.config.mjs properly handles Prisma in serverless environments
   - Add Prisma to the externals list in webpack configuration

## Step-by-Step Deployment Guide

1. **Prepare your database**:
   - Create a PostgreSQL database on Vercel, Supabase, Railway, or another provider
   - Get the connection string with proper connection pooling parameters

2. **Configure your project**:
   - Update your vercel.json file with the correct build commands
   - Ensure your database client is configured for serverless environments

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   - Add DATABASE_URL to your Vercel project
   - Add any other required environment variables

4. **Deploy your application**:
   - Push your code to your Git repository
   - Import the project in Vercel
   - Deploy with the correct settings

5. **Run migrations**:
   - After successful deployment, run migrations using Vercel CLI:
   ```
   vercel env pull .env.production
   npx prisma migrate deploy
   ```

## Testing Your Deployment

After deployment, test your application thoroughly:

1. **Check database connections**:
   - Test API routes that interact with the database
   - Verify that data is being read and written correctly

2. **Monitor logs**:
   - Use Vercel logs to identify any runtime errors
   - Look for database connection issues or timeouts

3. **Test serverless function limits**:
   - Be aware of the 10-second execution limit for serverless functions
   - Optimize database queries for performance

## Advanced Troubleshooting

If you're still experiencing issues:

1. **Use Prisma Data Proxy**:
   - Consider using Prisma Data Proxy for better connection management
   - Update your schema and connection string accordingly

2. **Implement connection pooling**:
   - Use PgBouncer or similar tools for connection pooling
   - Update your connection string to use the pooler

3. **Consider serverless limitations**:
   - Be aware of cold starts and connection limits
   - Optimize your code for serverless environments

4. **Check for region-specific issues**:
   - Ensure your database and Vercel deployment are in the same or nearby regions
   - Consider latency between your application and database

By following these steps and troubleshooting tips, you should be able to successfully deploy your Y-Gym application to Vercel with PostgreSQL.
